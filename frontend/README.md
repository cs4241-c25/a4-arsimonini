IMPORTANT NOTE: WHEN DEPLOYING, THE BUTTONS DO NOT WORK WITH SAFARI.
PLEASE USE GOOGLE WHEN GRADING THE PROJECT.

your hosting link: https://a4-arsimonini-frontend.onrender.com


I also have this one: https://a4-arsimonini-backend.onrender.com
but it doesn't do much


I mainly changed to a two server structure with frontend and backend using Vite. This allowed me to changed
my structure to allign with the React structure and jsx files as a whole. This means, though I run html
code, I don't use html files. I also finally fixed some of my flex box issues which was nice. Finally,
I created a new button for GitHub Passport Authentication. Now, you can click on the link and it will
ask you for your GitHub information and sign you in that way.
