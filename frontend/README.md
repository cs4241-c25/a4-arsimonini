IMPORTANT NOTE: I don't believe the github authentication will work locally anymore
due to me changing the OAth to fit what was needed for the hosting. So if you are to
judge that for a grade use the hosting link below.

Hosting link: https://a4-arsimonini-frontend.onrender.com


I also have this one: https://a4-arsimonini-backend.onrender.com
but it doesn't do much. Just the link associated with the backend portion


I mainly changed to a two server structure with frontend and backend using Vite. This allowed me to change
my structure to allign with the React structure and jsx files as a whole. This means, though I run html
code, I don't use html files. Everything is made in blocks as it is supposed to with React.
I also finally fixed some of my flex box issues which was nice. Finally, I created a new button for 
GitHub Passport Authentication. Now, you can click on the link and it will ask you for your GitHub information 
and sign you in that way.

So to conclude. When loading up https://a4-arsimonini-frontend.onrender.com head to the login page
either click register to go to the register page or GitHub Login to both sign in/register with GitHub.
If you register, then go to sign in on the sign in page with your account info and finally make asurvey submission.
Said submission should appear in the table exclusive to your account. You can also edit and delete any entry you make.
